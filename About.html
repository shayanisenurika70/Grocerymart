        Grocery marts, also known as grocery stores or supermarkets, are retail establishments that primarily sell food and other household items. They have evolved significantly over time, with many smaller grocery stores now focusing on niche markets by offering unique or ethnic foods that are not easily found in larger supermarkets. Supermarkets typically feature a wide range of products, including both food and non-food items, and have become a staple in modern retail due to their convenience and variety. Additionally, the grocery retail industry is increasingly adopting technology-driven efficiencies, such as online shopping and delivery services, to meet changing consumer demands.

        A supermarket is a large-scale retail establishment that specializes in necessities and convenience items. They have large warehouses and sell both food and non-food items. It could be entirely owned and operated, or it could have some departments that are leased out on a concessional basis.
